> API Workbench, a rich, full-featured integrated development environment (IDE) for designing, building, testing, documenting and sharing RESTful HTTP APIs. It supports both RAML 0.8 and the recently launched RAML 1.0. RAML makes it easy to manage the whole API lifecycle from design to sharing.

This repository contains the source code for the API Workbench plugin that you can easily install into [Github's Atom Editor](https://atom.io/).

Additional information such as tips on installation may be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/mulesoft/api-workbench/wiki).
